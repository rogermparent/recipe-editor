              "reviewBody": "Hi all, Keep in mind, the objective of the final step is to get slightly crispy outside with a moist, tender inside. The recipe says a \"clove\" of garlic ... I meant a bulb, but of course, garlic to taste, and for that matter, salt. Remember to adjust your salt and spices to the size of the roast, but broth doesn't need the same levels of increases. If you're not a salty person, salt the roast as you normally would. If you feel like you're over-salting, then you probably are. Also, make sure you're using Kosher style salt. If reg. salt, use less. The level of fat on your roast also plays a role - more fat, less salt. Written a long time ago -- I don't use cans of broth, just the sealed boxes -- about 1 will do. I have also used pork loin, and it tends to dry out-- try to buy one with more fat than you normally would. Shoulder/butt is much better.\n\nI often put the dutch oven in the oven at about 300-325 degrees, depending on how fast you need it to cook. I have a summer version where I marinate the pork pieces in lime, garlic, olive oil, adobo chili sauce, cilantro, and onion. I then grill outdoors to get the browned edges, and then set up a disposable aluminum pan covered with foil to do the braising in broth. I keep it on the grill on very low heat until tender. Then move the pieces indoors to finish with the same steps as the winter version. \n\nSome great ideas here - crock pot/ coke/beer. It's not an exact science. It's just a cooking technique."

I substituted 2 chicken boullion cubes for 4 cans and 1 bottle 16.9 oz drinking water for water. I placed all ingredients in an electric pressure cooker, on high, for 90 minutes. After a normal release, I adjusted the salt and spread refried beans on a large flour tortilla with a scoop of this Pork Carnitas, Herdez hot salsa and Monterey jack cheese for one of the best burritos I've ever tasted.",
